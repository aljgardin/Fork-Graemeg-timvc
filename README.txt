# Lee's MVC implementation for tiOPF

Lee has disappeared and I couldn't get hold of him at all. But not to let this
open source code follow his disappearance, I decided to share it in my Github
account.

## Usage
Take a look at the tiOPFMapper utility found in tiOPF's **tiopf-apps** code
repository. The Delphi GUI utility uses this MVC implementation, and it seems
to be working very well.
